<h3 align="center">The quickest way to write a book/PDF using Markdown.</h3>

## Why ?

Have you found yourself having to create a PDF for school or for work ? I did, quite a lot and nowadays you can use Word, Google docs or even LaTeX if you ~~want~~ have to. I actually always found myself writing it in Markdown because it is so simple and easy to use but sadly I couldn't find an editor that gave enough control of the design and the output. It is also not suitable for anything more serious like a memoir, where LaTeX is a requirement but it shouldn't be one, with some tweaking Markdown is just as good, if not better because it lets you focus on the most important thing, your text.

## How ?

The goal of this web application is to bring back the simplicity of writing a book back to its golden age, to the typewriter, while giving a realtime preview of the PDF, just like before. It fixes all the other issues, by giving you a total control of the design, everything about the output is fully customizable. Yet, this editor is still feature-complete, you can use anything that you're used: images, codeblocks, emojis, HTML, LaTeX.

## What ?

So here's Quickbook. What I believe is the simplest but fully capable book maker.
